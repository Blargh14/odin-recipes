    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The ever elusive dish known as ice inside of water.</p>
    <p>Tall tales are told of master chefs who are able to use a single substance, but alternate the temperature of it to have it exist in two different states, creating a vastly superior form of water.</p>
    <p>With modern technology however, we will let the machine do it. Then assemble it ourselves.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <uo>
        <li>Water below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, shaped to your liking. Quanity variable.</li>
        <li>Water above 32 degrees Fahrenheit, shape fluid. Quantity variable.</li>
    </uo>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stare at icemaking device. Could be a fridge or any temperature control device rated below 32 F.</li>
        <li>Once device makes clinking noises, remove the amount of ice you would like to use.</li>
        <li>Fill container of your choice with dihydrogen monoxide, colloquially known as "water". Be careful on this step, as ice will add volume.</li>
        <li>Add ice to dihydrogen monoxide.</li>
        <li>sip</li>
        <li>yum</li>
    </ol>
